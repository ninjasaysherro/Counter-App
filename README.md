<h1>Counter App</h1>

This is my first project that I've built using React. 
I watched and coded along a video tutorial by Mosh Hamedani, where he explains the process of building this counter app for beginners.
The app takes a number starting from zero and increments it by one. It also allows you to update and delete counters.
I've added a button that allows you to create additional counters and label them as to keep track of each individual counter. These were not included in the video but is a demonstration of what the video had taught me in regards to React.
